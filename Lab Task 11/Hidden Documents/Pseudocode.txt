START

1. Import train_test_split, SVC, and accuracy_score from sklearn

2. Split dataset into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2)

3. Choose SVC model for testing
   model = LinearRegression()

4. Train the model on training data
   model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

5. Make predictions on test data
   Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

6. Calculate accuracy
   r2 = r2_score(test_y, y_pred_linear)
   mse = mean_squared_error(test_y, y_pred_linear)
   PRINT accuracy
